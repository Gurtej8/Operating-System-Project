Ques 21:
Consider that a system has P resources of same type. These resources are shared by Q processes time to time. All processes request and release the resources one at a time. Generate a solution to demonstrate that, the system is in safe state when following conditions are satisfied. 
Conditions: 
1. Maximum resource need of each process is between 1 and P. 
2. Summation of all maximum needs is less than P+Q

Ques 48:
CPU schedules N processes which arrive at different time intervals and each process is allocated
The CPU for a specific user input time unit, processes are scheduled using a preemptive round robin scheduling algorithm. Each process must be assigned a numerical priority, with a higher number indicating a higher relative priority. In addition to the processes one task has priority 0. The length of a time quantum is T units, where T is the custom time considered as time quantum for processing .If a process is pre-empted by a higher priority process, the pre-empted process is placed at the end of the queue. Design a scheduler so that the task with priority 0 does not starve
for resources and gets the CPU at some time unit to execute. Also compute waiting time, turn around.
